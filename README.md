On the top right corner, you can see an burger icon which offers you differents possibilites, such as login / register, take a look at your watchlist when you're logged in, but also filter the contents depending on their disponibilites on VOD Services (Disney, MyCanal, Netflix, Paramount...)

You can also click on a content to discover the detail page, where you can play the content trailer.

All this website have been done with react, a mongodb / express / node based backend, and tailwind library to make the css more faster to use.

Please note that tailwind is not a component library, but an easier and faster way to add style to the DOM Objects. Indeed, all the components have been done by the hand.
